# Real-Estate-Pricing-Optimization-Under-Financial-Constraints
This repository contains a high-level description of a Pricing Optimization project in Real Estate (RE). The scope of this project ranges from data scraping, to single-point market value prediction for RE assets, to time-on-market or time-to-sell prediction given a price, to price optimization.

The work and results are summarized in [ten summary slides](https://github.com/PierreCounathe/Real-Estate-Pricing-Optimization-Under-Financial-Constraints/blob/main/Dynamic%20Pricing%20Optimization%20in%20Real-Estate%20under%20financial%20and%20time%20constraints.pdf).
